# MyST Editor

Copyright (c) 2022-2024 [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com)

This is a [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.16.0/) editor in a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) component, using [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) as the templating language.

## Features

### Live preview

Changes in the text editor are immediately reflected in the preview.

## Usage

### Building the component

```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

### Using as a library

You can embed this editor on another website.

After building, you should see a `dist` folder with `MystEditor.css` and `MystEditor.js` in it.
Put those files alongside your HTML.

Add a link to the css file into yout HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="MystEditor.css">
```

Add the following html where you want the editor to be:

```html
<div id="myst"></div>
```

Add the following javascript as a module (of course add any props as needed):

```js
import MystEditor, { html, render } from 'MystEditor.js'
render(html`<${MystEditor} />`, document.getElementById("myst"))
```

And voila!

### Developing / running the demo

There is a demo available for the editor with some example markdown and templates, also useful for development of the component itself.

To run it locally, use:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your terminal will display what URL to open to see the demo.
You can edit the source files in `src/` to modify the behavior of the component, with hot reload thanks to Vite.

An analogous demo deployed with GH actions from latest main should be deployed at https://antmicro.github.io/myst-editor/

### Collaboration Server

The example server is located in the `bin` directory. To run it use:

```bash
cd bin
yarn && yarn server
```

You can change the port it runs on with setting a `PORT` environment variable.
